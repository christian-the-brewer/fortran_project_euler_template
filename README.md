# Project Euler Fortran Template

This bash script takes one parameter, a problem number, and creates a .f90 file in your current working directory with a template for working on a project Euler problem.

## Future Work
In the future I would like the ability to add the URL of the problem and have the title, number, and prompt automatically scrapped.
